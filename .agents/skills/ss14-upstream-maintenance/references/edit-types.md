# Edit Types

## Preferred Edit Order

1. configuration or prototype-only edit
2. extend an existing public system API
3. narrow patch in an upstream content file
4. fork-only sidecar file under `_OpenSpace`
5. engine edit as explicit last-resort escalation

## Rule

Choose the earliest option that fully solves the task without hiding fork behavior in unrelated files, duplicating logic, or hardcoding a one-off case that should stay reusable.
